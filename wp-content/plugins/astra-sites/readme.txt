== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will the Starter Templates plugin work with my theme? =

We've certainly used Astra to build all our starter templates and recommend you to do so. However, in Starter Templates 2.0 onward all the starter sites or individual page templates you import are theme independent and blend well with the theme you have.

= Are all the starter templates FREE? =

You get over 90+ FREE ready-to-use websites as of now. There are many more premium website demos that can be accessed when you purchase one of our Agency Bundles - (i.e. either the Mini Agency or the Agency Bundles)

= How can I install and import starter templates? =

Here is an article that will help you install and import [Starter Templates](https://wpastra.com/docs/installing-importing-astra-sites/?utm_source=wp-repo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=readme) on your website.

= Can I import a website / page demo on an existing website? =

It is recommended to install and import a website demo on a fresh WordPress installation or a blank website to avoid overriding of settings and page design.

A page template can however be imported on an existing website as well.

= Can I deactivate the Starter Templates plugin after importing a website? =

Yes! The Starter Templates plugin acts as a medium through which you can import and install a website from our cloud server. Once you have the website at your end, you can go ahead and deactivate the plugin.

= Do I need to install any other plugin before importing a website? =

All you need to do is install the Starter Templates plugin and select the website demo you wish to import. While the site is being imported, you will come across a step in which the plugin asks you to click on a button that says Install plugins. This step will install and activate the necessary plugins.

= Will you add more website demos? =

Yes! We are working on many more free website demos built using Elementor, Beaver Builder and the Block Editor.

= What if I do not find a website for the topic I am looking for? =

We are open to suggestions and would love to work on topics that our users are looking out for. Please feel free to drop your suggestions through the [form here].(https://wpastra.com/sites-suggestions/?utm_source=wp-repo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=readme).
