# Delta Program website
Delta is the Fontys ICT excellence program where students get to explore technologies and learn while participating in real-world projects with external stakeholders. Therefore this website aims to show what Delta is about and what projects we built.

To make upkeep as easy as possible the website is built in WordPress for the built-in content management system combined with [ACF](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/) for custom post types.
