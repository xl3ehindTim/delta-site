# Delta Program website
Delta is the Fontys ICT excellence program where students get to explore technologies and learn while participating in real-world projects with external stakeholders. Therefore this website aims to show what Delta is about and what projects we built.

## Project overview
The website is built with [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) and [Avanced Custom Fields](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/). This combination allows for complete customizability of the website and its features while also allowing for easy maintance using the content management system. The main functionalities of the website are projects, student profiles, and information about the Delta Excellence Program.
